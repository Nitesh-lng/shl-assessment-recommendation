The UCF is a \nstructured and evidence-based competency framework that provides a rational, \nconsistent, and practical basis for understanding people’s behavior at work and \ntheir likelihood of success. The most detailed level of the UCF consists of SHL’s \nuniversal skills taxonomy. The Global Skills Assessment measures each of these 96 \nskills, providing a comprehensive understanding of workplace behavior. \n Job Level All \n Job Family/Tree All \nDetails Platform TalentCentral | TalentCentral+ \n Average Testing Time 15 minutes \n Number of Questions 76 (triplets) \n Designed for Unproctored Environment Yes \n Question Format Forced Choice \nKnowledge, \nSkills, \nAbilities, and \nCompetencies \nMeasured \nThe GSA is a versatile assessment, measuring all 96 skills in the Skills Taxonomy of \nthe UCF in only 15 minutes. It is used in all 8.0 Job Focused Assessments (JFAs) and, \nalthough scores for all skills are generated, only a subset of scales is reported. \nThese are usually scales for skills identified as important through job analysis. \nThe GSA measures universal skills, or patterns of workplace behavior relevant to \ndifferent job roles. The GSA can help organizations: \n• Identify the applicants with behavioral skills already suited to job roles \n• Identify incumbent strengths and growth areas \n• Redeploy talent across the business \n \nThe GSA is not available by itself for stand-alone off the shelf use, but is available in \nJFAs, for use with the Skills Development Report, and for use with a custom report. \nReports for the GSA are designed to ensure that results can be meaningfully \ninterpreted and understood in business contexts. The reports are designed for use \nin business by managers, trained HR professionals, or participants and provide: \n• Targeted, user-friendly and professional formats \n• Clear, concise language with easy-to-understand graphical summaries \n• Insightful information to use across multiple contexts \n  \n \nVersion: 1.0 | Last updated: May 21, 2024 \n© 2024 SHL and its affiliates.

The \nSales Report is a valuable online tool that makes recruiting or developing sales people easier and \nmore cost-effective. \nThe Sales Report helps to: \n Identify top sales performers \n Recruit sales people with the potential to sell more \n Reduce the costs of turnover in sales teams \n Develop existing sales teams \nKnowledge, \nSkills, Abilities \nand \nCompetencies \nMeasured \n \nThe Sales Report is based on the OPQ32 and, optionally, the Motivation Questionnaire. Combined, \nthese tools offer a precise and in-depth picture of the important factors relevant for success in sales. \nIt measures success factors in three main areas: \n Sales Foundations: Factors important to sales effectiveness in most sales situations \n Sales Cycle: How an individual is likely to perform in specific sales situations \n Motivation: Aspects of motivation critical to keeping sales people performing at their peak \n \nThere are also additional tools available that support the use of the Sales Report. These are \navailable in a more limited number of languages than the report. These tools include SHL Sales \nModel Profiler cards and the Sales Report Interview Guide.  \nThe Sales Model Profiler cards have been developed to enable clients to use the Sales Report more \neffectively, by helping clients to understand which competencies and motivators described in the \nreport are most important to a specific sales role.  \nThe Sales Report Interview Guide provides a structured way of gathering information about each \ncandidate and their competency potential in relation to a sales role. It is based on the 22 \ncompetencies and motivators in the SHL Sales Model and can be used to identify relevant areas to \nprobe during an interview."

Links the essential/desirable competencies for a specific job with an individual’s competency potential. Provides an overall Match (or fit) Score useful in ranking/sorting candidates for selection \nand/or development (e.g. Talent Audit).  It provides a highly visual profile of a candidate's strengths and limitations against identified required competencies. Includes a summary table that enables prioritisation of action planning for development of critical competencies for an individual (by tabling Competency Potential against Job Importance for the role). It includes highly descriptive statements about a candidate's strengths and development  needs/limitations. \nThe extended report versions include proposed competency-based interview questions \nto enable probing of specific situations in which the candidate might have \ndemonstrated critical job behaviours. \n  \nThe PJM Report is designed for use by line managers and HR professionals in selection and \ndevelopment situations. It is valuable for identifying an individual's overall fit as well as likely areas of \nstrength and weakness relative to their behaviour at work. \n \nIn a selection context, this information can be used: For making interviewers aware of the areas that may need further probing. As a basis for suggesting and creating relevant interview questions. For identifying the relative strengths and weaknesses of shortlisted candidates.",

The \nSales Report is a valuable online tool that makes recruiting or developing sales people easier and \nmore cost-effective. \nThe Sales Report helps to: \n Identify top sales performers \n Recruit sales people with the potential to sell more \n Reduce the costs of turnover in sales teams \n Develop existing sales teams \nKnowledge, \nSkills, Abilities \nand \nCompetencies \nMeasured \n \nThe Sales Report is based on the OPQ32 and, optionally, the Motivation Questionnaire. Combined, \nthese tools offer a precise and in-depth picture of the important factors relevant for success in sales. \nIt measures success factors in three main areas: \n Sales Foundations: Factors important to sales effectiveness in most sales situations \n Sales Cycle: How an individual is likely to perform in specific sales situations \n Motivation: Aspects of motivation critical to keeping sales people performing at their peak \n \nThere are also additional tools available that support the use of the Sales Report. These are \navailable in a more limited number of languages than the report. These tools include SHL Sales \nModel Profiler cards and the Sales Report Interview Guide.  \nThe Sales Model Profiler cards have been developed to enable clients to use the Sales Report more \neffectively, by helping clients to understand which competencies and motivators described in the \nreport are most important to a specific sales role.  \nThe Sales Report Interview Guide provides a structured way of gathering information about each \ncandidate and their competency potential in relation to a sales role. It is based on the 22 \ncompetencies and motivators in the SHL Sales Model and can be used to identify relevant areas to \nprobe during an interview."

So, the calculation is the cost of the car post-\ndiscount divided by 85 (to find 1% of the full price), then multiplied by 100 to obtain the full cost pre-\ndiscount.

Additionally, this test has been developed to assess the \nability to understand percentages, fractions, decimals, proportions, basic geometry, basic \nprobability, and the ability to compute solutions accurately using addition, subtraction, \nmultiplication, and division. This test does not, however, assess numerical sequences, advanced \ngeometry, statistics, measurement conversions (e.g., grams to pounds), or any concept that \nrequires outside knowledge to solve (all required information is provided in question stems). \nCandidates will be asked to make correct decisions or inferences from numerical or statistical \ndata.

So, the calculation is the cost of the car post- \ndiscount divided by 85 (to find 1% of the full price), then multiplied by 100 to obtain the full cost pre- \ndiscount. So the answer is D: £11,176.47"

      "description": "SHL 360, or the Multi-Rater Feedback System (‘MFS’), provides a holistic 360-degree view of an employee by gathering feedback from the employee’s manager, peers, direct reports, and/or other raters.  By offering a wide range of perspectives, 360 feedback gives employees a more thorough understanding of not only their strengths, weaknesses, and development opportunities, but also their impact on others.  360-degree multi-rater assessments are based on SHL’s Universal Competency Framework (“UCF”), using our proven library of research-driven competencies to provide opportunities for managers, peers, and direct reports to supply useful developmental feedback that they may not otherwise share.  SHL can also offer support and training throughout the entire process, from defining objectives through interpreting and delivering the feedback.  360 feedback serves all levels and industries and is a positive and powerful addition to your performance management system.",
